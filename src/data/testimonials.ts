I would normally manually adjust our schedule on paper, making sure time was divided equally among four classes. But I can do it much more quickly with the app. The interface is user-friendly, allowing me to quickly input available time and the number of classes, and it automatically generates an alternate schedule that makes sense for everyone. I highly recommend for teachers juggling multiple classes and frequent schedule changes!",
