        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>When assemblies, fire drills, or weather delays throw your schedule off, you need a solution that works fast. Traditional manual calculations can take 10-15 minutes, but modern apps can create balanced schedules in under 2 minutes. Here's how to instantly replan your school day when disruptions occur.</p>

        <h2>Step-by-Step Emergency Schedule Creation</h2>
        <h3>1. Assess the Disruption</h3>
        <p>First, determine how much time you've lost and what your new constraints are. For example, if a fire drill cut 30 minutes from your morning, you need to redistribute the remaining time across all subjects.</p>

        <h3>2. Input Your New Time Frame</h3>
        <p>Use your scheduling app to set the new start and end times. Most apps allow you to input specific times and automatically calculate the available instructional time.</p>

        <h3>3. Set Fixed Events</h3>
        <p>Include any fixed events that can't be moved, such as lunch, recess, or special activities. The app will account for these when calculating equal periods.</p>

        <h3>4. Generate Equal Periods</h3>
        <p>The app will automatically divide your remaining time into equal periods. If perfect division isn't possible, it will make most periods equal and adjust the last period slightly.</p>

        <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>
        <h3>Fire Drill Scenario</h3>
        <p><strong>Original Schedule:</strong> 7:55 AM - 3:00 PM (7 hours 5 minutes)<br>
        <strong>After Fire Drill:</strong> 8:25 AM - 3:00 PM (6 hours 35 minutes)<br>
        <strong>Result:</strong> 5 periods of 75 minutes each, with the last period getting 80 minutes to handle the odd division.</p>

        <h3>Assembly Interruption</h3>
        <p><strong>Original Schedule:</strong> 7:55 AM - 3:00 PM<br>
        <strong>Assembly Time:</strong> 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM<br>
        <strong>Result:</strong> Morning: 1 period of 65 minutes, Afternoon: 4 periods of 60 minutes each.</p>

        <h3>Weather Delay</h3>
        <p><strong>Original Schedule:</strong> 7:55 AM - 3:00 PM<br>
        <strong>Late Start:</strong> 10:00 AM - 3:00 PM<br>
        <strong>Result:</strong> 4 periods of 75 minutes each, with the last period getting 80 minutes.</p>

        <h2>Sharing Your Emergency Schedule</h2>
        <h3>Universal Links (Recommended)</h3>
        <p>Universal Links work for everyone - app users get direct import, non-app users see a web version. This is perfect for substitute teachers or colleagues who may or may not have the app installed.</p>

        <h3>QR Codes (App Users Only)</h3>
        <p>If you know the recipient has the app, QR codes provide instant import. Simply generate and share the QR code for immediate schedule access.</p>

        <h3>PDF Export</h3>
        <p>For professional documentation or posting in your classroom, PDF exports provide clean, printable schedules that include all necessary details.</p>

        <h3>Text Message Sharing</h3>
        <p>Quick text messages with schedule details work well for last-minute communication with administrators or parents.</p>

        <h2>Best Practices for Emergency Scheduling</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Keep It Simple:</strong> Focus on equal time distribution rather than complex scheduling patterns during emergencies.</li>

        <p>Decide on sharing methods for different scenarios: Universal Links for substitutes, PDFs for administrators, QR codes for app users.</p>

        <h3>3. Test Your Tools</h3>
        <p>Familiarize yourself with your scheduling app before emergencies occur. Practice creating emergency schedules to ensure you can do it quickly when needed.</p>

        <h3>4. Communicate with Stakeholders</h3>
        <p>Ensure administrators, substitute teachers, and parents know how to access your shared schedules. Provide clear instructions for different sharing methods.</p>

        <h2>Technical Considerations</h2>
        <h3>Universal Link Structure</h3>
        <p>Universal Links automatically detect whether the recipient has the app installed. If they do, the link opens the app and imports the schedule. If they don't, it opens a web version with the same information.</p>

        <h3>QR Code Generation</h3>
        <p>QR codes contain the same information as Universal Links but require the recipient to have the app installed. They provide instant import when scanned.</p>

        <h3>PDF Export Quality</h3>
        <p>PDF exports include all schedule details in a professional format suitable for printing or digital sharing. They maintain the same information as digital versions.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Universal Links provide the most flexible solution for sharing schedules with substitute teachers. They work for everyone, require no special setup, and ensure your substitute has all the information they need to maintain classroom continuity. Combined with other sharing methods, they provide comprehensive coverage for any substitute teaching scenario.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Morning assemblies are important school events, but they can throw your carefully planned schedule into chaos. When you return to your classroom with significantly less instructional time, you need a solution that works fast and maintains learning momentum. Here's how to handle assembly interruptions effectively.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Assembly Impact</h2>
        <p>Assemblies typically last 30-60 minutes and often occur during prime instructional time. This means you need to redistribute your remaining time across all subjects while ensuring each gets adequate attention. Modern scheduling apps can handle this automatically, creating balanced schedules in under 2 minutes.</p>

        <h2>Step-by-Step Assembly Recovery</h2>
        <h3>1. Calculate Available Time</h3>
        <p>First, determine your new available time. For example, if assembly runs from 9:00-10:00 AM and your day is 7:55 AM - 3:00 PM, you have 6 hours 5 minutes of instructional time remaining.</p>

        <h3>2. Use Intelligent Equal Division</h3>
        <p>Modern apps handle odd time divisions by making most periods equal and adjusting only the last period. This ensures maximum fairness while accounting for mathematical realities.</p>

        <h3>3. Consider Subject Priorities</h3>
        <p>While the app handles equal division, you can still make manual adjustments if needed. Consider giving slightly more time to core subjects if your schedule allows.</p>

        <h2>Real-World Assembly Scenarios</h2>
        <h3>Scenario 1: 30-Minute Assembly</h3>
        <p><strong>Original Schedule:</strong> 7:55 AM - 3:00 PM (7 hours 5 minutes)<br>
        <strong>Assembly Time:</strong> 9:00 AM - 9:30 AM<br>
        <strong>Available Time:</strong> 6 hours 35 minutes<br>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> 5 periods of 79 minutes each</p>

        <h3>Scenario 2: 60-Minute Assembly</h3>
        <p><strong>Original Schedule:</strong> 7:55 AM - 3:00 PM<br>
        <strong>Assembly Time:</strong> 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM<br>
        <strong>Available Time:</strong> 6 hours 5 minutes<br>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> 4 periods of 90 minutes each, with the last period getting 95 minutes</p>

        <h3>Scenario 3: Afternoon Assembly</h3>
        <p><strong>Original Schedule:</strong> 7:55 AM - 3:00 PM<br>
        <strong>Assembly Time:</strong> 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM<br>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Morning: 3 periods of 60 minutes each, Afternoon: 1 period of 60 minutes</p>

        <h2>Sharing Your Adjusted Schedule</h2>
        <h3>Universal Links (Recommended)</h3>
        <p>Share your adjusted schedule using Universal Links. These work for everyone - app users get direct import, non-app users see a web version. Perfect for substitute teachers or colleagues.</p>

        <h3>QR Codes (App Users Only)</h3>
        <p>If you know the recipient has the app, QR codes provide instant import. Simply generate and share the QR code for immediate schedule access.</p>

        <h3>PDF Export</h3>
        <p>For professional documentation or posting in your classroom, PDF exports provide clean, printable schedules that include all necessary details.</p>

        <h2>Best Practices for Assembly Recovery</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Act Quickly:</strong> Create your adjusted schedule within 2 minutes of returning to class</li>
          <li><strong>Maintain Subject Balance:</strong> Ensure all subjects get adequate time</li>
          <li><strong>Communicate Clearly:</strong> Share the new schedule immediately with all relevant parties</li>
          <li><strong>Consider Student Needs:</strong> Ensure the new schedule maintains appropriate breaks and transitions</li>
          <li><strong>Document Changes:</strong> Keep a record of schedule adjustments for future reference</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Advanced Recovery Techniques</h2>
        <h3>Template-Based Recovery</h3>
        <p>Save assembly recovery schedules as templates. This allows you to quickly adapt similar scenarios when they occur again.</p>

        <h3>Alarm Integration</h3>
        <p>Set alarms for the new class end times to help maintain the adjusted schedule. Modern apps support custom alarm sounds and can integrate with iOS AlarmKit for enhanced functionality.</p>

        <h3>Professional Documentation</h3>
        <p>Generate professional schedules for posting in your classroom or sharing with administrators. This ensures everyone stays informed about the adjusted schedule.</p>

        <h2>Prevention Strategies</h2>
        <h3>1. Prepare Templates</h3>
        <p>Create schedule templates for common assembly scenarios. This allows for instant adaptation when disruptions occur.</p>

        <h3>2. Establish Protocols</h3>
        <p>Decide on sharing methods for different scenarios: Universal Links for substitutes, PDFs for administrators, QR codes for app users.</p>

        <h3>3. Practice Recovery</h3>
        <p>Familiarize yourself with your scheduling app before emergencies occur. Practice creating emergency schedules to ensure you can do it quickly when needed.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Assembly interruptions don't have to derail your entire day. With the right tools and approach, you can recover quickly and maintain learning momentum. The key is using apps that provide intelligent equal-time division and multiple sharing options to ensure everyone stays informed and on schedule.</p>
