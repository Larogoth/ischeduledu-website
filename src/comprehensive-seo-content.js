<h2>Equal Time Lesson Planning App - iSchedulEDU</h2>
<p>Generate perfectly balanced schedules with equal time distribution. Handle schedule interruptions like lunch breaks while maintaining fair time allocation for all classes. Intelligent mathematical calculations ensure maximum fairness.</p>

<h3>How Equal Time Planning Works</h3>
<p>1. Set Time Frame: Input your start and end times, plus any fixed events. 2. Auto-Calculate: App divides remaining time into perfectly equal periods. 3. Review & Adjust: See your balanced schedule and make any final tweaks. 4. Save & Share: Save your equal-time template and share with others.</p>

<h3>Perfect Equal Time Schedule Example</h3>
<p>Real App-Generated Schedule: 7:55 AM to 3:00 PM with lunch interruption (11:00-11:30).

<h3>Equal Time FAQ</h3>
<h4>How does iSchedulEDU ensure truly equal time periods?</h4>
<p>The app uses intelligent mathematical calculations to divide your remaining time into equal periods. When perfect division isn't possible, it makes the first periods equal and adjusts the last period to handle any remaining minutes. For example, with 307 minutes divided into 5 periods, you'd get 4 periods of 61 minutes each, and the last period would be 63 minutes. This ensures maximum fairness while accounting for odd time divisions.</p>

<h4>Can I adjust the equal periods if needed?</h4>
<p>Yes! While iSchedulEDU creates perfectly equal periods automatically, you can always make manual adjustments if you need to prioritize certain subjects or accommodate special activities.</p>

<h4>What if I have an odd number of minutes remaining?</h4>
<p>iSchedulEDU handles odd numbers intelligently. It will create the most equal distribution possible, with any extra minute or two distributed strategically to maintain balance across your schedule.</p>
